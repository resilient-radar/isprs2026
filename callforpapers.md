## Review Process

All paper submissions to an Thematic Session will be subjected to the Congress deadlines and the ISPRS review process.
Details of the review process is given in the [ISPRS Announcement](https://www.icsevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ISPRS2026_2ndAnnouncement-Final.pdf)
The below is an excerpt from that document.

> Abstracts and full-length papers submitted to the Congress will be subjected to the
> ISPRS review process, a summary of which is provided herein. Authors should consult the
> following publication for complete details: [isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/IV5/53/2018/](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/IV-5/53/2018/).
> 
> Each of the five Technical Commission Presidents is known as Program Chair (PC). Following an initial check, the PC assigns
> each submitted abstract or paper to an Area Chair (AC). ISPRS Working Group officers, Thematic Session Chairs, and other external
> experts serve as ACs. The AC also checks the submission and invites reviewers to provide an evaluation. Upon receiving the reviews, the AC
> makes one of the following recommendations to the PC:
> 
> - Accepted for publication in the ISPRS Annals: full papers that were judged as the
> highest quality. Revisions to the paper may be required.
>
> - Accepted for publication in the ISPRS Archives: full papers not accepted for
> the ISPRS Annals but still deemed worthy of inclusion in the scientific program.
> Revisions may be required for the submitted full-length paper.
> 
> - Accepted for publication in the ISPRS Archives: extended abstracts that were
> judged to be of high quality. A full-length paper for which reviewer comments on
> the abstract have been addressed can be submitted.
> 
> - Extended abstracts accepted for presentation without publication of a fulllength paper.
> 
> - Rejected: full papers or abstracts that are not of sufficient quality.
> 
> The PC checks the recommendation and makes the final decision and recommends the presentation mode. The PCs are also
> responsible for checking that final paper submissions conform to the ISPRS template.
> The CSRS Technical Program Chair will coordinate the review process for submissions
> to CSRS Invited Sessions, the Applied Sessions (ISPRS and CRSS-SCT) and the Student
> Oral Paper and Poster Paper Awards at the Canadian Symposium on Remote Sensing competition.
> 
> The Scientific Chair (SC) oversees the entire process and builds the scientific program
> in consultation with the PCs and the CSRS Technical Program Chair.
